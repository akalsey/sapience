### Patch Changes

- 7da8039: Delivery finally works: openclaw's plugin registration guard voids `enqueueNextTurnInjection` after `register()` completes (it is missing from the late-callable allowlist in `api-lifecycle.ts`), which is why no injection has ever been delivered. `scheduleSessionTurn` IS late-callable — when the guard eats an injection, delivery now schedules an immediate one-shot agent turn in the main session instead. sapience-goals also picks up the probe/diagnostic work its stale copy of main-session was missing.
