Goals are now temporary skills that build their own todo list. On approach selection the agent compiles standing instructions ("when you access PostHog, remember the results; compare against what you know; explain trends and outliers; don't force conclusions") and seeds todos via the new `goal_plan` tool, which installs the instructions as a real workspace skill (`skills/goal-<id>/SKILL.md`) active in every session. `goal_todo` grows and burns down the checklist; completing the last todo starts wrap-up — confirm the outcome, complete via `goal_update` (which retires the temporary skill), and only when the goal produced a recurring analysis worth keeping, optionally distill it into a permanent skill. Thinking passes see each active goal's open todos and propose work that moves them.
