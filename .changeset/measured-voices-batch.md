Two fixes from watching a live proposal flood: a new `goal_list` tool lets the agent look up goal ids in later turns (every goals tool required an id the model had no way to retrieve — "I'm having trouble with the goal_select_approach tool"), and routing now injects at most `delivery.maxPerCycle` items per cycle (default 3, act-first then priority), queuing the overflow for the delivery cron to compose into one concise message instead of burying the user under eight boilerplate calibrate items in a single turn.
