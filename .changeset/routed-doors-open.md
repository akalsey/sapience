Configurable delivery target: set `plugins.entries.<id>.config.delivery.sessionKey` to route proposal/digest/status injections into a specific session (e.g. the operator's DM conversation) instead of the agent main session. On multi-user installs with `session.dmScope: per-channel-peer`, the main session is machine-only — questions asked there await answers that can never arrive; delivering into the operator's own conversation puts proposals where replies actually land.
