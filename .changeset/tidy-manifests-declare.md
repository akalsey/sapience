Declare every registered tool in each manifest's `contracts.tools` — openclaw rejects undeclared tools at registration ("plugin must declare contracts.tools for: <name>"), so `get_pending_deliveries`, `watch_metric`, `watch_remove`, `record_outcome`, and all five goal management tools have been silently absent from gateways since they shipped. A new manifest-contracts test in each package pins the manifest to the source so future tools can't ship undeclared.
