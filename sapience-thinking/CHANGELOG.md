## 0.4.10

### Patch Changes

- f58c099: When both the facade and the flat injection API resolve `undefined`, the `delivery_failed` reason now also embeds the flat function's source (`flatFn=`) — every published openclaw build wires an object-returning implementation there, so its body identifies which unexpected implementation production is actually calling.

## 0.4.9

### Patch Changes

- b5e986f: Injection calls that resolve `undefined` (an unidentified wrapper between the plugin and the gateway) now retry on the flat `api.enqueueNextTurnInjection`, and when that can't settle it either, the `delivery_failed` reason embeds the facade function's source so the wrapper can be identified from the event log.
